# Results and Concerns:
Is the Chi-squared test appropriate?
- Consider doing it manually without the square. Absolute value difference. What number of houses are more than 4% off (epsilon-delta?)
- The sampling method is simple random sampling (Not true? Collected 600 responses over email; also variables are related to one another (financial aid can be related to ethnicity))
- The variables under study are each categorical (Observations report counts for each categorical variable)
- If sample data are displayed in a contingency table, the expected frequency count for each cell of the table is at least 5 (Yes; enough data)

Interpretation of Chi-squared:
- The p-values are all very high (> 0.20) --> we accept the null hypothesis (we can't reject the null hypothesis) that the data are similar.


modify aggregate to multiply by house size not class
